Crypter-project
===============

This project converts text input to unreadable gibberish,
which can be then converted back to readable text.

In the GUI user types the desired text to a textfield, 
which will be then converted to gibberish by clicking 
the "Crypt it!"-button. The crypted text will be then 
shown in the next textfield.
